    "## I. Interacting With the Operating System\n",
    "Programming languages are nice for carrying out computations based on input data. They have useful constructs like `for` loops, `if` statements, and module systems so that you can reuse code easily. However, for certain tasks, what's built in to the programming language is simply not enough. For situations like this, programming languages usually allow explicit interaction with the underlying operating system. In Python, this is handled by the `os` module. The following graphic helps to describe how the underlying OS behaves and how we can interact with it:\n",
    "![OS Architecture Diagram](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.11/img/dcos-architecture-layers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you have been running in these notebooks fits into the \"services\" section of the software layer, and our OS interaction will allow us to request data and provide instructions to the objects in the \"platform\" layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that Python code is meant to be portable, and you have to be careful when using the `os` module to ensure that your code can still be run on your target systems. This course is designed for \\*nix  systems (including macOS and BSD), and certain code written in examples will not run on windows systems, especially code from this chapter. "

    "For things as universal as filesystem interaction, `os` has built-in functions to help you out. However, there are some things that the Python developers simply can't prepare for. Let's say you want to compile some code, run it, and print the output, all from within Python. This is simple with the command line, and Python's `os` module provides a way to run system commands through the command line, through a function called `os.popen()`. Please remember that this can be unsafe if you allow malicious actors to access your computer, so only use the `os.popen()` function when necessary."
