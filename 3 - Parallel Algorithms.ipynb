    "## I. Trivially Parallelizable Algorithms\n",
    "In order to properly make use of an HPC system or other parallel computing environment, you need to be able to make your code able to run in parallel. As we saw with our monte carlo pi example, even making the same algorithm run in parallel can make huge changes in terms of performance. If a job running on an HPC system has access to hundreds of cores, but is only written to run in serial, it will not make use of the computational resources it has available to it. In theory, if your task is completely parallelizable, then if you scale it up by a factor of _n_ cores, it will speed up _n_ times. That is to say, if you run a completely parallelizable job on 20 cores, it will run up to 20 times faster than on one core. A graph of this is below: ![Theoretical maximum speedup](https://cdn.comsol.com/wordpress/2014/03/Graph-depicting-how-the-size-of-the-job-increases-with-the-number-of-available-processes.png)\n",
    "This graphic represents the theoretical maximum speedup of various types of HPC jobs, where the x-axis represents the number of cores the job is run on, the y axis represents how much faster the job runs (i.e. if the y-value is 20, the job is 20 times faster than single core), and the value of _phi_ represents the fraction of the job that can be parallelized. The mathematical principle this is based on is called [The Gustafson-Barsis Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustafson%27s_law)\n",
    "\n",
    "The class of algorithms for which the value of _phi_ is 1, that is to say the class of algorithms that scale perfectly, is known as the \"trivially parallelizable\" class. This means that you can expect linear performance scaling as you increase number of cores linearly. These algorithms are, rather unsurprisingly, very easy to make parallel. Because of this, people using HPC systems often try to reduce their workloads to different \"building blocks\" made up of trivially parallelizable algorithms. A Trivially parallelizable algorithm is defined by task-independence. That is to say, if you break up an algorithm into tasks, in order for that algorithm to be trivially parallelizable, each task must not depend on the output of any other task. The image below represents a trivially parallelizable algorithm:\n",

    "## II. Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "Remember in the last section how I made a fuss about how, even though it seems really unlikely that real world applications would ever be even close to trivially parallelizable, it's a goal that many scientists and other HPC users aim for? Well, one of the tools these people commonly use to move that direction is the _monte carlo simulation_. We've already used monte carlo simulations to compute a numerical value of pi experimentally, but we haven't really strictly defined just what exactly a monte carlo algorithm _is_, so let's do that now. A _monte carlo algorithm_ is an algorithm that attempts to produce an answer to a question by simulating many possible outcomes. For example, our monte carlo pi simulates throwing a dart at a dartboard over and over, and then uses the underlying geometry of the situation to extract a value from those darts' randomly selected locations. A monte carlo algorithm is often trivially parallelizable, because random numbers, by definintion, can always be generated independently, that is with no input from each other. For this reason, many HPC users attempt to use the monte carlo method when attempting to solve problems with \"real\" values (i.e. numerically)."

    "Algorithms which can be run concurrently to great effect are often nice to work with. This is because they are, by definition, easy to speed up without too many resources. I like to refer to another class of easy to speed up tasks as _number crunching_. Tasks that fit into this category must a) have little or no input data, b) produce easy to handle amounts of output data, and c) use up at least an entire compute core for most of the time it needs to be running. Because of these requirements, Number crunching tasks are easy to speed up through parallelization, by adding more cores to a pool. They are slightly harder to speed up than tasks from the previous example, because they require additional hardware for more speedup, but they are still easy to speed up overall.\n",

    "At this point, you have learned about a whole bunch of different kinds of parallel, concurrent, and otherwise high-performance algorithms, and you should have a basic understanding of how to take regular, boring, slow serial code and use these tools to make it faster and more exciting. That's a great start as far as your parallel algorithms knowledge goes and it's fairly applicable to real world workloads that you may see, but I would be a bad teacher if I didn't spend at least a little time with _dataflows_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _dataflow_ is a set of different algorithms, which may or may not be parallel, that all fit together in some way, with the output of some parts leading to the input of other parts. Most real world HPC applications are not just simple SIMD or MIMD blocks, but are instead a number of different pieces of code, all of which produce data based on other applications or input data. Each of those individual pieces of code may be SIMD or concurrent, or trivially parallel, or monte carlo, or any other kind of code, but the important part is understanding how they all work together. The dataflow is an incredibly powerful way of \"gluing\" many programs together into one program that carries out exactly what you want it to. The image below is a representation of a dataflow: ![basic dataflow](http://www.digitaleng.news/de/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HPC-Workflow.jpg)\n",
    "In this case, data is first generated, then the quality of that data is assured, and then the data gets computed on, creating some output, and finally, that data gets visualized and consolidated to a human-readable format. This is a fairly common type of dataflow. "

    "The dataflow presented in the previous section is a relatively typical dataflow, but it's also farily complex. To give you a more gentle introduction to working with dataflows, we are going to design a dataflow called `sleep_fail`. This dataflow consists of a data generation layer, in which we define a function which sleeps for _n_ (user input) seconds before failing with a probability _p_ (also user input). Then, it writes whether it failed or succeeded to a file. Then, we have a data consolidation layer, which reads that file and prints out how many times it ran, succeeded, and failed.
