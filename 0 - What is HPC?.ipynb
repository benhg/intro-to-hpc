    "## What is High-Performance Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people believe that High-Performance Computing (HPC) is defined by the architecture of the computer it runs on. In standard computing, one physical computer with one or more cores is used to carry out a task. All of these cores can access a pool of [Shared Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory). Shared memory makes it trivial for two or more programs or parts of a single program to understand what other programs are doing. The following diagram represents a multicore single computer working in this fashion: ![multicore architecture diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/31/f8/2231f856a5341e19526d089e1ffbe630.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "On the other hand, most high performance systems are clusters which consist of many separate multicore computers which are all connected over a network. In this configuration, the individual parts of a program running on separate physical machines are not easily able to communicate without connecting over the network. The following diagram represents a cluster of multicore computers working as a single cluster:  ![HPC cluster architecture diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/31/f8/2231f856a5341e19526d089e1ffbe630.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",

    "Because of the dependence on networking, programming for HPC environments requires special considerations that normal programming does not."
