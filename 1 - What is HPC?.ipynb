    "## I. What is High-Performance Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people believe that High-Performance Computing (HPC) is defined by the architecture of the computer it runs on. In standard computing, one physical computer with one or more cores is used to carry out a task. All of these cores can access a pool of [Shared Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory). Shared memory makes it trivial for two or more programs or parts of a single program to understand what other programs are doing. The following diagram represents a multicore single computer working in this fashion: ![multicore architecture diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/31/f8/2231f856a5341e19526d089e1ffbe630.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "On the other hand, most high performance systems are clusters which consist of many separate multicore computers which are all connected over a network. In this configuration, the individual parts of a program running on separate physical machines are not easily able to communicate without connecting over the network. The following diagram represents a cluster of multicore computers working as a single cluster:  ![HPC cluster architecture diagram](http://cialisalto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/excellent-hpc-cluster-architecture-on-and-contemporary-with-data-5.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",

    "As an example of \"traditional\" computation, we will now compute the numerical value of Pi through the monte carlo simulation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. We will discuss them in more detail in the parallel algorithms notebook. A very common monte carlo simulation uses some basic geometry to estimate the numerical value of pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we imagine a circle of radius 1 inscribed in a square. Then, we choose random points in the square, and classify them by whether they are inside the circle or outside. This gives us an estimate of the areas of the square and the circle. Then, we take the ratio of one to the other and we have an estimation of pi. If this doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry.

    "## II. Why is HPC important?\n",
    "High performance computing opens the door to large scale data analysis, computational science, and research computing. It is useful in a number of scenarios, including where software is too time-critical, too performance critical, or simply too big to run on a traditional system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a few examples of scenarios where you would need an HPC System or an HPC System drastically changes your process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario 1: Real-Time App:** Let's imagine you're an app developer working for The Weather Channel. You want to make an app that automatically detects where a person is, very specifically, and then uses your complex AccuWeather analysis to predict the likelihood of rain any time in the next seven days for that specific location. You would like your user to be able to get this data within seconds. There is no way you will be able to serve this user, let alone your millions of other users, this data with a single traditional computer. Having an HPC system available here is extremely important, in order to ensure your users get their weather in close to real time. ![Weather Models](http://aemstatic-ww1.azureedge.net/content/ias/en/articles/2012/08/honeywell-3d/_jcr_content/leftcolumn/article/headerimage.img.jpg/1345596242801.jpg \"\")\n",
    "- **Scenario 2: Designing a New Car or Plane:** You're a brand new aerospace engineer working for the Mercedes-Benz Formula One team. You have the off season (usually between December and May, or about five months) to design a new car which is better than all the cars that beat you last year. Traditionally, the way to do this is start with a small model, put it in a wind tunnel, evaluate it, and repeat this process. Then, you slowly scale up to bigger models and eventually start building concept cars. However, you only have five months, and each model may take a month to design and produce. You simply don't have time. Instead, you get started with your HPC system and start creating some [Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) models which you can then use to create your new car with plenty of time to spare. The image below is the output of a CFD model. ![CFD model of car](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Verus_Engineering_Porsche_987.2_Ventus_2_Package.png \" \")\n",
    "- **Scenario 3: Computational Climate Research:** Let's say you are a climate scientist. You want to simulate the climate of the entire world. You want to put in what the world was like in 1900, then press the play button, and simulate the entire 1900s in the entire world. Then, you want to compare what that looks like to what actually happened in the 1900s, and finally, if that's good enough, you want to keep playing through until 2100. This is simply too big a task to run on a normal computer; you will be waiting literally for years before your job exits.\n",

    "## III. Multiprocessing\n",
    "One of the reasons this course is written in python is that python is an easy to use language which is commonly used for computational science and other HPC applications. Another reason that Python was chosen for this course is Python's powerful _multiprocessing_ library. _Multiprocessing_ allows users to open subprocesses within python in order to run many different snippets of python code all at once. In the following examples, we will use _multiprocessing_ to speed up our computations. It is true that Python has a GIL (global interpreter lock) which keeps it from natively running truly parallel programs, but with multiprocessing, we can get around this at the expense of heavier RAM overhead. The purpose of this course is not necessarily to write the fastest possible code, but more to demonstrate the techniques, methods, and tools for doing that in the future, and Python is an easily understandable and highly readable language. The following image is a description of how multiprocessing can help speed up Python programs: ![Multiprocessing Diagram](https://sebastianraschka.com/images/blog/2014/multiprocessing_intro/multiprocessing_scheme.png \"\")"

In the case of the cluster this course is running on, the network is a bus topology, meaning that all of the nodes are plugged into a single network switch. The graphic below illustrates some common network topologies:\n",

    "With multiple computers working together, HPC systems are able to achieve massive performance. The fastest system in the world is a cluster like this which runs at a peak of roughly 200 Petaflops, or 200 quadrillion floating point operations per second. Because these systems have programs that take up more than a whole node, they need a way to understand which parts of programs are running on which nodes. The way this is usually handled is through inter-process communication. We will get into this concept more in topic 5: distributed algorithms, but essentially, one part of a program will send a message to another part of the same program and tell it what information it needs to know in order to do its job. The following image describes this process:\n",
    "![Message Passing Diagram](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/images/collective_comm.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image labeled \"broadcast\", a message-passing task is sending a message to all other running tasks. This can be useful to orchestrate many copies of the same program. In the image labeled \"scatter\", the task sends a personalized message to each other running task. this is useful when the same instruction needs to be performed with different input data. In the images labeled \"gather\" and \"reduction,\" the task receives messages from all other tasks and creates a summary of all the input data. This can be used in situations where data is generated by one part of a workflow and needs to be processed later. Please keep in mind that there are many more applications of inter-process communication. "
