    "## I.What is High-Performance Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people believe that High-Performance Computing (HPC) is defined by the architecture of the computer it runs on. In standard computing, one physical computer with one or more cores is used to carry out a task. All of these cores can access a pool of [Shared Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory). Shared memory makes it trivial for two or more programs or parts of a single program to understand what other programs are doing. The following diagram represents a multicore single computer working in this fashion: ![multicore architecture diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/31/f8/2231f856a5341e19526d089e1ffbe630.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "On the other hand, most high performance systems are clusters which consist of many separate multicore computers which are all connected over a network. In this configuration, the individual parts of a program running on separate physical machines are not easily able to communicate without connecting over the network. The following diagram represents a cluster of multicore computers working as a single cluster:  ![HPC cluster architecture diagram](http://cialisalto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/excellent-hpc-cluster-architecture-on-and-contemporary-with-data-5.jpg \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the dependence on networking, programming for HPC environments requires special considerations that normal programming does not."

    "### Example 1.1 - computing pi on a standard computer\n",
    "As an example of \"traditional\" computation, we will now compute the numerical value of Pi through the monte carlo simulation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. We will discuss them in more detail in the parallel algorithms notebook. A very common monte carlo simulation uses some basic geometry to estimate the numerical value of pi. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we imagine a circle of radius 1 inscribed in a square. Then, we choose random points in the square, and classify \"them by whether they are inside the circle or outside. This gives us an estimate of the areas of the square and the circle. Then, we take the ratio of one to the other and we have an estimation of pi. If this doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry.
